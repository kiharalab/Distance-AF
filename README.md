	abstract = {The three-dimensional structure of a protein plays a fundamental role in determining its function and has an essential impact on understanding biological processes. Despite significant progress in protein structure prediction, such as AlphaFold2, challenges remain on those hard targets that Alphafold2 does not often perform well due to the complex folding of protein and a large number of possible conformations. Here we present a modified version of the AlphaFold2, called Distance-AF, which aims to improve the performance of AlphaFold2 by including distance constraints as input information. Distance-AF uses AlphaFold2{\textquoteright}s predicted structure as a starting point and incorporates distance constraints between amino acids to adjust folding of the protein structure until it meets the constraints. Distance-AF can correct the domain orientation on challenging targets, leading to more accurate structures with a lower root mean square deviation (RMSD). The ability of Distance-AF is also useful in fitting protein structures into cryo-electron microscopy maps.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.},

## Installation

### System Requirements
CPU: >=8 cores <br>
Memory (RAM): >=50Gb. For fasta sequence than 3,000 residues, memory space should be higher than 200GB if the sequence is provided. <br>
GPU: any GPU supports CUDA with at least 12GB memory. <br>
GPU is required for Distance-AF and no CPU version is available for Distance-AF since it is too slow.

### 2. Run Distance-AF with user specified target
#### 2.1 Prepare Input files
 + Target file: text file, for example: `1IXCA`
 + 1IXCA
 + Fasta file: fasta format file, for example: `1IXCA.fasta`
 +  \>1IXC chain A
MEFRQLKYFIAVAEAGNMAAAAKRLHVSQPPITRQMQALEADLGVVLLERSHRGIELTAAGHAFLEDARRILELAGRSGDRSRAAARGDVGELSVAYFGTPIYRSLPLLLRAFLTSTPTATVSLTHMTKDEQVEGLLAGTIHVGFSRFFPRHPGIEIVNIAQEDLYLAVHRSQSGKFGKTCKLADLRAVELTLFPRGGRPSFADEVIGLFKHAGIEPRIARVVEDATAALALTMAGAASSIVPASVAAIRWPDIAFARIVGTRVKVPISCIFRKEKQPPILARFVEHVRRSAKD

 + User specified distance constraint file: text format , we recommend users to specify as many constraints you have to achieve better performance. In the following example, we use 6 pairs of distance constraints.
 + `15,221,35.3`: the distance constraint between CA atom of resi 15 and CA atom of resi 221 is 35.3 Å.
 + `17,232,36.9`: the distance constraint between CA atom of resi 17 and CA atom of resi 232 is 36.9 Å.
 + `45,150,34.3`: the distance constraint between CA atom of resi 45 and CA atom of resi 150 is 34.3 Å.
 + `55,190,45.8`: the distance constraint between CA atom of resi 55 and CA atom of resi 190 is 45.8 Å.
 + `65,266,36.0`: the distance constraint between CA atom of resi 65 and CA atom of resi 266 is 36.0 Å.
 + `79,126,22.8`: the distance constraint between CA atom of resi 79 and CA atom of resi 126 is 22.8 Å.
 + Initial predicted file in PDB with full length: PDB format, for example: `1IXCA_pred_full.pdb`
 + We recommend to use the predicted structure file which violates the given distance constraints as initial structure.
 + Domain window info file: text format to specify distince domains. To achieve domain oriented movement.
 + 1,87: resi 1 to resi 87 belong to the first domain.
 + 92,294: resi 92 to resi 294 belong to the second domain.
 + Embedding file: npz format . The output file after the evoformer layer in [AlphaFold2](https://github.com/google-deepmind/alphafold). ~~We released the google colab version of jupyter file '[Distance_AF_embedding.ipynb](https://github.com/kiharalab/Distance-AF/blob/main/Distance_AF_embedding.ipynb "Distance_AF_embedding.ipynb")' to generate embedding file. Please check [colab_embedding.md](https://github.com/kiharalab/Distance-AF/blob/main/colab_embedding.md) for more information.~~ 
 + ~~**Updates about Colab for generating embedding file**: Currently due to some errors about google colab runtime changes, the [Distance_AF_embedding.ipynb](https://github.com/kiharalab/Distance-AF/blob/main/Distance_AF_embedding.ipynb "Distance_AF_embedding.ipynb") is not working, it will be available again after AlphaFold2 team fix the problem([issue here](https://github.com/google-deepmind/alphafold/issues/875)). Please use [Distance_AF_embedding_v2.ipynb](https://github.com/kiharalab/Distance-AF/blob/main/Distance_AF_embedding_v2.ipynb) to generate embeddings, this script is based on [ColabFold using MMseq](https://colab.research.google.com/github/sokrypton/ColabFold/blob/main/AlphaFold2.ipynb). The new colab sciprt will run MMseq for MSA search, which may produce different results compared to vanilla AlphaFold2.~~
 + **Updates about Colab for embedding generation**: Currently the bug in [Distance_AF_embedding_FullMSA.ipynb](https://github.com/kiharalab/Distance-AF/blob/main/Distance_AF_embedding_FullMSA.ipynb) has been fixed and is runnable to get embeddings. Thanks to the efforts from everyone in [issue 875](https://github.com/google-deepmind/alphafold/issues/875). Meanwhile, I kept the mmseq version of colab [Distance_AF_embedding_MMseq.ipynb](https://github.com/kiharalab/Distance-AF/blob/main/Distance_AF_embedding_MMseq.ipynb). Compared to Full MSA version, it is faster but sometimes the quality of MSAs are not so good. Therefore, [Distance_AF_embedding_FullMSA.ipynb](https://github.com/kiharalab/Distance-AF/blob/main/Distance_AF_embedding_FullMSA.ipynb)  is still recommended.

#### 2.3 Example command

    python3 main.py --target_file=Example/1IXCA/1IXCA --emd_file=Example/1IXCA/model_1.npz --dist_info=Example/1IXCA/dist_constraint.txt --window_info=Example/1IXCA/window.txt --initial_pdb=Example/1IXCA/1IXCA_pred_full.pdb --fasta_file=Example/1IXCA/1IXCA.fasta --output_dir=./example_output --model_dir=./model_dir --dist_weight=0.5 --loose_dist=1 --device_id=1
### 3. Result check
The predicted structure by Distance-AF will be saved at `--output_dir`, you can specify any local path you'd like. The intermediate structures will also be stored every 100 epochs in each corresponding subdirectories like `**checkpoint-100-100**` or so.
